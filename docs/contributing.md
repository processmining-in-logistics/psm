# Performance Spectrum Miner - Contribution Guidelines

We are in the process of setting up contributing guidelines. 
For now, we welcome everyone to experiment with the code provided, clone it and develop new features.
If you happen to hit on something useful, reach out to us or prepare a pull-request.

##Submitting changes
Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to psm](https://github.com/processmining-in-logistics/psm/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests). 
Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
