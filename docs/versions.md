## Why the new version of the Performance Spectrum Miner (PSM)?

The new version of the PSM supports the multi-channel Performance Spectrum (PS), introduced in the paper, while the previous version v1.0.x supports only a single channel of the PS. The multi-channel PS contains more information, so the PS data format was changed to 1) store multiple PS channels and 2) support large datasets of MHS (e.g., we have been working with event logs, which contain up to 250.000.000 events and lead to a multi-channel PS with 800.000 bins on the bin axis. Currently this version is available as a stand-alone tool, we plan to release the corresponding ProM plugin soon.
